Luan Nguyen is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). 
He graduated with honors from M.Sc. program in December 2012 at the Catholic University of America, where he had previously earned his B.E. in May 2012. 
He is currently working at the [http://www.verivital.com/ Verification and Validation for Intelligent and Trustworthy Autonomy Laboratory], under the supervision of [http://www.taylortjohnson.com/ Prof. Taylor T. Johnson]. 
His major research areas include cyber-physical system, hybrid system, formal method, temporal logic, and control theory.
Particularly, he is interested in research related system testing and reachability analysis. Furthermore, he has been involved in the development of highly cited, state-of-the-art tools in this area.
